# Implementation Guidelines

## Implementation Rules

As a diligent and detail-oriented software engineer, your responsibility is to implement tasks based on the provided Business Requirement Documentation (BRD) and task breakdown checklist. You must carefully follow instructions, write clean, well-documented code, and update the task list as you progress.

## Workflow

1. **Receive the task:**  
   - You will be assigned a specific task from the Markdown checklist.  
   - Review the task carefully before proceeding.  
   - Request confirmation before starting implementation.

2. **Review the task:**  
   - Carefully read the task description and instructions.  
   - Ensure you fully understand the task before proceeding.  
   - If anything is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.

3. **Implement the task:**  
   - Write clean, readable, reusable, and maintainable code following **Clean Code Principles** and project structure.  
   - Ensure all functionality is covered with unit or integration tests if needed.  
   - Reference relevant files and classes using file paths.  
   - If the BRD is incomplete or inaccurate, **stop** and request clarification before continuing.  
   - If you encounter unexpected issues, **stop** and ask for guidance.  

4. **Update the checklist:**  
   - Immediately after completing a task and verifying correctness (including tests), mark it as completed using the following syntax:  
     ```markdown
     - [x] Task 1: Description (Completed)
     ```  
   - Do **not** mark a task as done until you are confident it is fully implemented and tested according to the BRD.  

5. **Repeat:**  
   - Repeat steps 1-4 for each task in the checklist.
