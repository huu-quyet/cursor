# Login Screen Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the login screen and OTP verification based on the Figma design and business requirements.

## Component Structure

### 1. Login Page (`pages/Login/index.tsx`)

- Main container for the login screen
- Handles form state and submission
- Manages routing to OTP verification

### 2. Components

- `LoginHeader` (`pages/Login/components/LoginHeader.tsx`)

  - Logo and title display
  - Reusable across login-related screens

- `LoginForm` (`pages/Login/components/LoginForm.tsx`)

  - Username and password inputs with validation
  - Remember me checkbox
  - Login button
  - Alternative login option

- `OTPVerification` (`pages/Login/components/OTPVerification.tsx`)
  - OTP input fields with auto-focus
  - Verification button
  - Resend OTP functionality

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setup (Day 1)

- [x] Extract Figma design data (Completed)
- [x] Create necessary component files (Completed)
- [x] Set up routing configuration (Completed)
- [x] Configure authentication store (Completed)

### 2. Core Components Development (Day 1-2)

- [x] Implement LoginHeader (Completed)

  - Logo and title styling
  - Responsive layout

- [x] Implement LoginForm (Completed)

  - Form validation using react-hook-form
  - Password visibility toggle
  - Error handling
  - Remember me functionality
  - API integration

- [x] Implement OTPVerification (Completed)
  - OTP input with auto-focus
  - Validation and error handling
  - Timer for resend functionality
  - API integration

### 3. State Management & API Integration (Day 2)

- [x] Set up authentication store using Zustand (Completed)

  - User state
  - Login status
  - Token management

- [x] Implement API services (Completed)
  - Login endpoint
  - OTP verification endpoint
  - Token refresh

### 4. Testing & Optimization (Day 3)

- [ ] Unit tests for components
- [ ] Integration tests for authentication flow
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility improvements

## Technical Decisions

### State Management

- Using Zustand for global state management
  - Lightweight and simple API
  - Easy integration with React
  - Built-in TypeScript support

### Form Handling

- React Hook Form for form management
  - Performance optimized
  - Built-in validation
  - TypeScript support

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
  - Matches design system
  - Responsive by default
  - Easy to maintain

### API Integration

- React Query for data fetching
  - Caching and synchronization
  - Loading and error states
  - Automatic retries

## Security Considerations

- Implement CSRF protection
- Secure token storage
- Rate limiting for OTP attempts
- Input sanitization
- Password strength requirements

## Accessibility

- ARIA labels for form inputs
- Keyboard navigation support
- Error announcements
- Color contrast compliance
- Focus management

## Performance Optimization

- Code splitting for routes
- Lazy loading of components
- Image optimization
- Caching strategies
- Bundle size optimization

## Next Steps

1. ~~Begin with component setup and routing~~ (Completed)
2. ~~Implement core components~~ (Completed)
3. ~~Add state management and API integration~~ (Completed)
4. Complete testing and optimization
