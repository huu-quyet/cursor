- Use utility classes directly in your JSX/HTML for faster development and easier maintenance
- Group related utility classes using the `@apply` directive in custom components
- Configure theme extensions in `tailwind.config.js` to maintain a consistent design system
- Implement responsive design using Tailwind's responsive utility classes
- Use state variants (e.g., `hover:`, `focus:`, `active:`) to handle different interaction states
- Set up a proper purge configuration to remove unused styles and optimize bundle size
- Define a consistent color palette and use semantic color naming for better maintainability
- Implement dark mode using Tailwind's built-in dark mode support
- Use Tailwind's built-in accessibility features to ensure your UI is accessible
- Monitor and optimize your CSS bundle size to improve page load times
